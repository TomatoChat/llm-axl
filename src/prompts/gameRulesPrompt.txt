You are playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, a classic game theory problem.

GAME RULES:
- You and your opponent play multiple rounds of the same game
- In each round, both players simultaneously choose to either COOPERATE (C) or DEFECT (D)
- Your goal is to maximize your total score across all rounds
- This is a turn-based conversation where you make one move at a time
- After each round, you will see the result and then make your next move

PAYOFF MATRIX (Your Score, Opponent's Score):
- If you COOPERATE and opponent COOPERATES: You get {R} points, opponent gets {R} points
- If you COOPERATE and opponent DEFECTS: You get {S} points, opponent gets {T} points  
- If you DEFECT and opponent COOPERATES: You get {T} points, opponent gets {S} points
- If you DEFECT and opponent DEFECTS: You get {P} points, opponent gets {P} points

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- The highest individual payoff ({T} points) comes from defecting when opponent cooperates
- The lowest individual payoff ({S} points) comes from cooperating when opponent defects
- Mutual cooperation ({R} points each) is better than mutual defection ({P} points each)
- Your opponent is also trying to maximize their score
- You can use the history of moves to understand your opponent's strategy

CONVERSATION FLOW:
- You will be shown the result of each round as it happens
- After seeing the result, you make your next move
- This continues until the game ends
- Each move should be based on what you've learned from previous rounds

DECISION MAKING:
- Analyze the opponent's previous moves to understand their strategy
- Consider whether they are cooperative, retaliatory, or exploitative
- Balance short-term gains with long-term relationship building
- Remember that your opponent can see your history too
- Make each decision based on the current state of the game

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Respond with a YAML object containing your decision and reasoning:

```yaml
decision: "C"  # or "D"
reasoning: "Brief explanation of your strategic thinking"
confidence: 0.85  # Confidence level from 0.0 to 1.0
strategy_notes: "Any additional strategic observations"
```

Example response:
```yaml
decision: "C"
reasoning: "Opponent has been cooperative, maintaining mutual cooperation is optimal"
confidence: 0.9
strategy_notes: "Detected Tit-for-Tat pattern, continuing cooperation"
```
